/* When I overrided getName, the result given by speak() went from displaying the name as OtherName [the name of the Bird] to displaying
The Mighty OtherName, which was the name but with "The Mighty" put before it.

Bird to animal didn't work because Bird is a more complex Class than animal, and changing it to animal would remove information, which is
not allowed by Java.
